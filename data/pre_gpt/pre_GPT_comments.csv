[Lifeguard training](https://cultureofsafety.thesilverlining.com/videos/commandments/20-second-rescue/)

>As was mentioned above, it is important that a responding lifeguard use extreme caution when responding to a victim. A lifeguard should always put their own safety above anyone else’s. After all, if a distressed swimmer unintentionally puts a lifeguard in harm’s way both may need to be rescued.

You can wait to rescue them and then provide CPR, and prevent there being 2 victims.

 The Lifeguard training is Reach, Throw, Row, and Go, but still with an emphasis to not let them grab you.

>4\. GO if the first 3 steps can't be used as a last resort swim to the victim. Keeping your eyes on the victim, kick off your shoes and disrobe. Jump; do not dive, into the water. Carry your shirt or towel in your teeth. Keep your eyes on the victim. Swim out near enough to extend your towel or shirt to him and tow him in by it. If you have nothing to extend to him. approach him from behind and tow him to safety by his hair.

>5\. Don't allow the victim to latch onto you. Don't attempt a rescue beyond your swimming ability. The victim is in survival mode and will do anything to keep themselves from drowning, even if that means pushing you down into the water without knowing it.

None of this is for simple shallow water rescue like Pools, but large/open water rescue.",36,2021-09-10 15:33:26,True,hcb3hcz

I could not even count the times across my life I've heard the advice from those with experience, cautioning not to go near a drowning person without a HEALTHY measure of hesitation.  Often times people can latch onto you and pull you under water so that they can gasp for air.  Packs of old surfers in Australia when I was travelling said the same thing; you never swim over to help someone panicking in the water, you just let them hang on to your board.  Even the most basic and foundational first aid starts off with the pure protection of the rescuer, where you have to examine the environment for your own safety first and completely before assisting anyone else no matter how dire.",2,2021-09-10 17:09:39,True,hcb3hcz

I absolutely disagree with this statement. although the numbers can give an advantage in a battle, other factors such as environment, deception and morals had been a key in battles won by smaller number armies. 

For example, the battle of Yarmouk and the battle of Al Qadisiyah are a few battles that come to my head. The Battle of Dhi Qar is another example where the number of men did not win the Persian battle.  The Vietnam war saw extensive use of the environment and a drop in American's morale by the Vietnamese despite their lack of technological advancement and equipment to which the Americans had access.

Overall, despite having all this technological equipment, the war is still the same in the foundation for thousands of years. Yes, the weapons became different, political relationships changes, but it is humans that are actually fighting.

Note: some of these technologies may not be as advanced as you might think.",1,2021-09-11 07:54:50,True,hcd7a96

[Lifeguard training](https://cultureofsafety.thesilverlining.com/videos/commandments/20-second-rescue/)

>As was mentioned above, it is important that a responding lifeguard use extreme caution when responding to a victim. A lifeguard should always put their own safety above anyone else’s. After all, if a distressed swimmer unintentionally puts a lifeguard in harm’s way both may need to be rescued.

You can wait to rescue them and then provide CPR, and prevent there being 2 victims.

 The Lifeguard training is Reach, Throw, Row, and Go, but still with an emphasis to not let them grab you.

>4\. GO if the first 3 steps can't be used as a last resort swim to the victim. Keeping your eyes on the victim, kick off your shoes and disrobe. Jump; do not dive, into the water. Carry your shirt or towel in your teeth. Keep your eyes on the victim. Swim out near enough to extend your towel or shirt to him and tow him in by it. If you have nothing to extend to him. approach him from behind and tow him to safety by his hair.

>5\. Don't allow the victim to latch onto you. Don't attempt a rescue beyond your swimming ability. The victim is in survival mode and will do anything to keep themselves from drowning, even if that means pushing you down into the water without knowing it.

I could not even count the times across my life I've heard the advice from those with experience, cautioning not to go near a drowning person without a HEALTHY measure of hesitation.  Often times people can latch onto you and pull you under water so that they can gasp for air.  Packs of old surfers in Australia when I was travelling said the same thing; you never swim over to help someone panicking in the water, you just let them hang on to your board.

I absolutely disagree with this statement. although the numbers can give an advantage in a battle, other factors such as environment, deception and morals had been a key in battles won by smaller number armies. 

For example, the battle of Yarmouk and the battle of Al Qadisiyah are a few battles that come to my head. The Battle of Dhi Qar is another example where the number of men did not win the Persian battle.  The Vietnam war saw extensive use of the environment and a drop in American's morale by the Vietnamese despite their lack of technological advancement and equipment to which the Americans had access.

Overall, despite having all this technological equipment, the war is still the same in the foundation for thousands of years. Yes, the weapons became different, political relationships changes, but it is humans that are actually fighting.

[Lifeguard training](https://cultureofsafety.thesilverlining.com/videos/commandments/20-second-rescue/)

>As was mentioned above, it is important that a responding lifeguard use extreme caution when responding to a victim. A lifeguard should always put their own safety above anyone else’s. After all, if a distressed swimmer unintentionally puts a lifeguard in harm’s way both may need to be rescued.

You can wait to rescue them and then provide CPR, and prevent there being 2 victims.

 The Lifeguard training is Reach, Throw, Row, and Go, but still with an emphasis to not let them grab you.

>4\. GO if the first 3 steps can't be used as a last resort swim to the victim. Keeping your eyes on the victim, kick off your shoes and disrobe. Jump; do not dive, into the water. Carry your shirt or towel in your teeth. Keep your eyes on the victim. Swim out near enough to extend your towel or shirt to him and tow him in by it. If you have nothing to extend to him. approach him from behind and tow him to safety by his hair.

>5\. Don't allow the victim to latch onto you. Don't attempt a rescue beyond your swimming ability. The victim is in survival mode and will do anything to keep themselves from drowning, even if that means pushing you down into the water without knowing it.

Often times people can latch onto you and pull you under water so that they can gasp for air.  Packs of old surfers in Australia when I was travelling said the same thing; you never swim over to help someone panicking in the water, you just let them hang on to your board.

In the past, the side with the most numbers won.

I absolutely disagree with this statement. although the numbers can give an advantage in a battle, other factors such as environment, deception and morals had been a key in battles won by smaller number armies. 

For example, the battle of Yarmouk and the battle of Al Qadisiyah are a few battles that come to my head. The Battle of Dhi Qar is another example where the number of men did not win the Persian battle.  The Vietnam war saw extensive use of the environment and a drop in American's morale by the Vietnamese despite their lack of technological advancement and equipment to which the Americans had access.

Overall, despite having all this technological equipment, the war is still the same in the foundation for thousands of years. Yes, the weapons became different, political relationships changes, but it is humans that are actually fighting.

[Lifeguard training](https://cultureofsafety.thesilverlining.com/videos/commandments/20-second-rescue/)

>As was mentioned above, it is important that a responding lifeguard use extreme caution when responding to a victim. A lifeguard should always put their own safety above anyone else’s. After all, if a distressed swimmer unintentionally puts a lifeguard in harm’s way both may need to be rescued.

You can wait to rescue them and then provide CPR, and prevent there being 2 victims.

 The Lifeguard training is Reach, Throw, Row, and Go, but still with an emphasis to not let them grab you.

>4\. GO if the first 3 steps can't be used as a last resort swim to the victim. Keeping your eyes on the victim, kick off your shoes and disrobe. Jump; do not dive, into the water. Carry your shirt or towel in your teeth. Keep your eyes on the victim. Swim out near enough to extend your towel or shirt to him and tow him in by it. If you have nothing to extend to him. approach him from behind and tow him to safety by his hair.

>5\. Don't allow the victim to latch onto you. Don't attempt a rescue beyond your swimming ability. The victim is in survival mode and will do anything to keep themselves from drowning, even if that means pushing you down into the water without knowing it.

Often times people can latch onto you and pull you under water so that they can gasp for air.  Packs of old surfers in Australia when I was travelling said the same thing; you never swim over to help someone panicking in the water, you just let them hang on to your board.

[Lifeguard training](https://cultureofsafety.thesilverlining.com/videos/commandments/20-second-rescue/)

>As was mentioned above, it is important that a responding lifeguard use extreme caution when responding to a victim. A lifeguard should always put their own safety above anyone else’s. After all, if a distressed swimmer unintentionally puts a lifeguard in harm’s way both may need to be rescued.

You can wait to rescue them and then provide CPR, and prevent there being 2 victims.

 The Lifeguard training is Reach, Throw, Row, and Go, but still with an emphasis to not let them grab you.

>4\. GO if the first 3 steps can't be used as a last resort swim to the victim. Keeping your eyes on the victim, kick off your shoes and disrobe. Jump; do not dive, into the water. Carry your shirt or towel in your teeth. Keep your eyes on the victim. Swim out near enough to extend your towel or shirt to him and tow him in by it. If you have nothing to extend to him. approach him from behind and tow him to safety by his hair.

>5\. Don't allow the victim to latch onto you. Don't attempt a rescue beyond your swimming ability. The victim is in survival mode and will do anything to keep themselves from drowning, even if that means pushing you down into the water without knowing it.

At least pick a country that is somewhat resembling western standards. A docu i saw the other day was specifically explaining how they cant get enough food types in their diet, because they relied on vegetarian based diets which does not provide enough nutrients on its own as it is now (not diverse enough to provide vitamins and protein) because they do not have acces to what is needed to grow and sustain your body, resulting in the deaths of babies and young children. I know, it is also atributed to poor sanitary and hygienic standards. But you cant say they are healthy because they really are not.

No. Although Mark is considered the most reliable gospel (or the one based more in reality), [it was written around 70 AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark)

You will note that in Mark, it doesn't have the freaky stuff. Jesus didn't raise the dead. And there is also no account of his resurrection- merely that the tomb was empty. As well, in Mark, Jesus doesn't his father to forgive his crucifiers, instead, he laments, 'Why hast thou forsaken me?'

John, on the other hand, is the most fantastical of the gospels, and is also written the furthest from Christ's death.

Learning in person with a very experienced / master level artisan or practitioner means you will experience a wealthy knowledge base and depending how they teach and if you are receptive to their style of teaching, hopefully effective constructive criticism and guidance. This style can also lead down the path of ""one way or the highway"" and cause people to, zealously hyper fixate on that one person's style.

Self teaching has its benefits in the sense that almost any skill can be basically achieved or comprehended. The downsides in juxtaposition to the first are that without correction, guidance and criticism it is easy to become blind to one's own flaws and shortcomings, in turn leading to a false sense of mastery, in the absence of any true skilful reflection. This method also heavily relies on one's ability to analyse source material and distinguish between the useful, effective and practical methodologies and the, superfluous, exaggerated or consuming processes.

I honestly believe a mixed approach (self study and practice, then approaching lessons and skilled persons) is the best style and once comfortable with the basic concepts, a period of refinement alone.

This goes a level below your suffering explanation. The suffering has to come from somewhere – bad childhood, loneliness, poverty, disease and so on. But suffering isn't the only reason for people to be ""evil"".  Someone like Kim Jong Un, the Taliban in Afghanistan or slavers in the South were/are the way they are because they were born into a society that taught them that certain behaviors and norms, which we consider to be evil, were actually good and important to uphold. It was never their choice to be born into those societies and, unless they experienced some environmental impact to change their minds, they simply upheld the system they were born into.

The vast majority of all people, including you and me, would be fundamentalist jihadists if we had been born within a Taliban community, or slavers if we had been born into the antebellum South.

Humans with a psychopathic brains aren't necessarily suffering either. They have been born with a brain disorder that simply makes them incapable of caring for other people's feelings. It was never their choice and they never even had the option to choose differently.

People highly overestimate the ability of people to choose what they think and how they behave. For many, it's uncomfortable to think about that but it can also be a freeing experience, because it helps in getting rid of hating people and holding grudges.

(It isn't an argument against incarceration and punishment, however, since we should incarcerate people who threaten society, regardless of their ability to choose their behavior and we can still use punishment as a deterrent for other people.)",3,2021-09-10 09:36:21,False,

They’re a band that your parents prolly listen to. And the kid was like no my parents don’t listen to guns and roses and then asked me if dinosaurs washed their hands. So yeah. I think questions are the most important part of learning. It shows interest and curiosity. And sating their curiosity is gonna stick a lot more than a strict lesson plan.

I had a shitty teacher and i struggled in all subjects for a long time because i was scared of teachers, i was scared of asking questions.

It would be like telling that cancer patient, “just get chemo” or “just don’t smoke or eat red meat”.

I can’t speak for the populous however many people find themselves fatter than they ever thought they would be after years of issues regarding self esteem, mental health issues such as depression, or after tragic life events (granted my sample size here is small). In these instances it would be like telling someone with depression “just stop being sad”, or someone with low self esteem “just tell yourself you’re pretty” or the victim of abuse “just forget about it”.

So whilst yes physically there’s steps that can be taken to avoid getting fat or to lose weight, obesity or fatness is usually not as simple to solve as many people think.

My personal experience is that I fluctuate between the very top of my healthy weight and being slightly overweight. Which side I’m on is directly linked to how I’m doing in terms of my mental health.

I know, that just hitting the gym isn't sufficient advice for obese people. However it is a good beginning step to overcome the mental blockades some people have about exercising. If a person (obese or not) does not exercise enough, the body will not produce enough happiness hormones. That can lead to negative thoughts and depressions, which on its own leads to inactivity, which leads to the person in question getting fatter and fatter.

It's important to break out of this downward spiral, so your body can make more happiness hormones. This is why it psychologists advise depressed people to exercise.

Back to those mental blockades and physical blockades of obese people. Even if you're incapable of running due to your weight, it is important to exercise. So to everyone who is reading this, stop saying everyone is bodyshaming you, and get out of your chair and take daily walks. Don't immediately go for multiple kilometers if you think you can't, just start with walking around the block a few times.
